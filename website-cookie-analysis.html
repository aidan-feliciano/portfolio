    <h1>Website Cookie Analysis - December 2024</h1>
    
    <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>How can businesses utilize website cookie data to better understand, target, and extract revenue from their online customer base? This project aims to understand and analyze behavior patterns, revenue drivers, and predictors of customer transactions.</p>

    <h2>Dataset Overview </h2>
    <p>
      We used anonymized <strong>cookie-level</strong> web data from an online store. The data spans from 8/1/2010 to 1/31/2011. There are over 16,000 records, with each representing a "website session," 
      where the online store tracks user activity on the website. To clarify, a <i>cookie</i> is a packet of data sent by a web server to a browser and then returned 
      back by the browser each time the user subsequently accesses the same server. Cookies are used to identify users and track their activity. Below is the full data dictionary.
    </p>

    <p>INSERT DATA DICTIONARY</p>
    
    <h2>Data Preparation & Cleaning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dropped columns where all values were either 1 or 0 (e.g., Nuber of Records, goalCompletionsAll).</li>
      <li>Removed ~200 rows with missing values.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exploration & Segmentation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There were 3,570 different cities representing 697 different regions</li>
      <li>Top cities included New York, Moscow, Kyiv, and London.</li>
      <li>Users were segmented by engagement level (based on time on site):
        <ul>
          <li>Low: 0–28 min</li>
          <li>Medium: 29–87 min</li>
          <li>High: 87+ min</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p>INSERT WEBSITE COOKIE SCREENSHOT</p>
      <p>We can see from the screenshot above that the referral process needs attention, as it is the lowest driver of revenue by a significant portion for all three engagement levels.</p>
      <p>We also found that the online store follows a seasonality that is expected in ecommerce, where we see higher webstore traffic, revenue, and time spent on site leading up the US holiday season (November and December), and then a sharp decrease after.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Search Engines & Revenue</h2>
    <p>We ran a multiple linear regression on organic traffic to determine search engines' impact on revenue. Key findings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google</strong> had a significant positive effect, adding ~$9.37 per visit.</li>
      <li>Each visit added ~$15.86 to revenue; each bounce lost ~$19.55.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Predicting Transactions</h2>
    <p>We tested both logistic regression and random forest to predict whether users would make a transaction.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Logistic regression</strong> was chosen for simplicity, with an accuracy of 89.81%.</li>
      <li><strong>Significant predictors</strong>: medium (organic), new visits, visits (+); bounces (–).</li>
      <li>Organic users were 1.5× more likely to transact than others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring & Targeting</h2>
    <p>Using predicted probabilities, we prioritized users for targeting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Top 102 users</strong> delivered ~100 transactions (limited supply rule).</li>
      <li><strong>Top 953 users</strong> had a transaction rate above 50% (marginal supply rule).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Business Insights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus SEO efforts on Google keywords and rankings.</li>
      <li>Invest in partnerships and re-engagement campaigns to drive visits.</li>
      <li>Improve site experience to reduce bounce rates (chatbots, mobile-first design).</li>
    </ul>
