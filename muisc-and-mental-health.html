    <h1>Music & Mental Health Analysis</h1>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Can music listening habits predict or influence mental health outcomes? Our study explores how preferences around genre, frequency, and context relate to mental health conditions including anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. We also evaluate whether music can be recommended as a potential support tool for mental well-being.
    </p>

    <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>
      We used the <strong>Music & Mental Health Survey</strong> from Kaggle, created by Catherine Rasgaitis at the University of Washington. The dataset covers a wide range of attributes: demographic information, music listening patterns, genre preferences, and self-reported mental health scores. Data was collected from 8/27/2022 to 11/9/2022.
    </p>

    <h2>Goal / Key Questions</h2>
    <p>Our analysis was guided by the following research questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do different age groups exhibit distinct listening behaviors?</li>
      <li>Can we predict an individual’s mental health condition based on their music habits?</li>
      <li>Does music measurably improve or worsen mental health?</li>
      <li>Can we recommend genres to support mental health improvement?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Business Insights</h2>

    <h3>Listening Habits by Age Group</h3>
    <p>
      We discovered that musical preferences vary significantly by age. Rock, Pop, and Metal were among the most frequently listened genres across age brackets, while genres like K-pop, Rap, and Lofi skewed heavily toward younger listeners. Classical music, Gospel, and Latin saw higher engagement among older respondents. While usage of platforms like Spotify dominated across all groups, we noticed that older adults reported fewer overall survey responses, which may limit the generalizability of conclusions for that group.
    </p>

    <h3>Predicting Mental Health Conditions</h3>
    <p>
      We applied linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost to predict self-reported anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD scores. Across the board, models performed poorly (R² values < 0.1), suggesting that music habits alone are not strong predictors of mental health scores. Even after introducing engineered features and classification frameworks (Low/Medium/High severity buckets), model accuracy remained around 50–55%. These results highlight that mental health outcomes are likely influenced by external and subjective factors not captured in the dataset.
    </p>

    <h3>Does Music Impact Mental Health?</h3>
    <p>
      We shifted our focus to whether individuals felt that music improved, worsened, or had no effect on their mental health. Using a Random Forest Classifier with class balancing, we achieved an accuracy of <strong>77.03%</strong>, with key predictors including hours listened per day, background usage (e.g. while working), and genre choice. Notably, Lofi listeners reported the highest mental health scores—though this may reflect coping behavior rather than causation. Gospel and Latin music also appeared to correlate with better well-being.

    <h3>Genre Recommendations Using Clustering</h3>
    <p>
      To offer personalized genre recommendations for individuals who reported that music worsened or had no effect on their mental health, we used K-Means clustering with PCA for dimensionality reduction. The final model generated <strong>39 distinct listener groups</strong>, producing a silhouette score of 0.5—indicating solid cluster separation. For each group, we recommended three genres based on frequency and popularity within the segment. For instance, users who frequently listened to Video Game Music were recommended Jazz, Classical, and Rock as alternatives.

    <h2>Actions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data exploration:</strong> Explored relationships between music preferences and mental health conditions by age, genre, and listening frequency.</li>
      <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> Deployed regression and classification models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to assess predictive power and recommend actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Clustering & Recommendation:</strong> Used K-Means and PCA to create actionable genre recommendations for personalized mental health support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitations & Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      The study faced several limitations: small sample size for older groups, highly subjective self-reporting, and lack of external behavioral indicators. Future work should include broader mental health metrics (e.g. stress levels, sleep quality), and explore synthetic data generation (e.g. SMOTE) to balance class representation.
