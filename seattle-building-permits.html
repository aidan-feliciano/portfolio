<h1>Seattle Building Permits Analysis</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
How is construction activity distributed across Seattle? We aimed to understand where, what, and how building projects are happening across the city using permit data to uncover trends and draw conclusions for real estate stakeholders and potential homebuyers.
</p>

<h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
<p>
We used 2023 building permit data from the <a href="https://data.seattle.gov">City of Seattle Open Data Portal</a>. The dataset contains 5,596 rows, each representing a unique building permit. There were 25 columns representing attributes for each permit, such as project cost, permit class, housing units, zip code, and more.
</p>

<h2>Goal / Key Metrics</h2>
<p>
Our objective was to find insights that could help real estate investors or potential homebuyers identify and target potential neighborhoods in whcih to purchase/invest in property. Key metrics included: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identifying high-growth zip codes</li>
  <li>Comparing commercial vs. residential permit activity
  <li>Estimating project costs and approval timelines</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>
We completed several steps during our analysis: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Data cleansing and preprocessing</b>: Addressing missing values, data spillage, and correcting datatypes.</li>
  <li><b>Exploratory data analysis</b>: Visualizing permits by class and zipcode, plotting distributions for permit approval time and permit costs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Findings</h2>
<h3>High-growth zip codes:</h3>
  <p>The zip codes in Seattle and their corresponding neighborhoods with the highest number of permits in 2023 were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>98115: Roosevelt, Ravenna, Wedgewood</li>
    <li>98103: Greenlake, Wallingford, Greenwood</li>
    <li>98117: Ballard, Blue Ridge</li>
    <li>98118: Rainier Valley, Seward Park, Rainier Beach</li>
  </ul>
  <p>MAYBE INCLUDE THE VISUAL ON SLIDE 14</p>

<h3>Permit approval times:</h3>
  <p>50% of permits were approved within 50 days, with the approval equaling 79 days</p>
  <p> INSERT VISUAL HERE DISTRIBUTION ON SLIDE 23</p>
  <p>The zip codes with the most expensive estimated project costs were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>98121: Belltown</li>
    <li>98109: Queen Anne</li>
    <li>98108: South Seattle, Beacon Hill</li>
    <li>98101: Downtown Seattle</li>
  </ul>
 

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
  
<p>Real estate investors or potential home buyers who want to purchase properties in areas with a lot of active or planned development (i.e., areas that may boom in the next few years and therefore bring more traffic or drive up real estate prices) may want to consider building in the ZIP codes with high numbers of permits: 98115, 98103, 98117, and 98118. The same may be true for real estate developers, if theyâ€™re looking to develop new properties in areas where a lot of development has recently happened or is planned. <br><br>
Potential home buyers looking for quiet neighborhoods that will not experience significant change or development may want to focus on the ZIP codes with fewer permits. <br><br>
Additionally, by knowing the average project costs for each Zip Code, developers can better allocate their finances. They also may be able to execute more financially feasible projects by selecting areas with lower average project costs
</p>

  
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Integrate this data with <b>property values</b> or <b>rental rates</b></li>
  <li>Analyze <b>time series</b> trends (e.g., seasonality in applications)</li>
  <li>Use <b>clustering or PCA</b> for dimensionality reduction across project types</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python for data cleansing, and visualizations (matplotlib and seaborn)</li>
  <li>SQL for exploratory analysis</li>
</ul>
