<h1>Seattle Building Permits Analysis</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
How is construction activity distributed across Seattle? We aimed to understand where, what, and how building projects are happening across the city using permit data to uncover trends and draw conclusions for real estate stakeholders and potential homebuyers.
</p>

<h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
<p>
We used 2023 building permit data from the <a href="https://data.seattle.gov">City of Seattle Open Data Portal</a>. The dataset contains 5,596 rows, each representing a unique building permit. There were 25 columns representing attributes for each permit, such as project cost, permit class, housing units, zip code, and more.
</p>

<h2>Goal / Key Metrics</h2>
<p>
Our objective was to find insights that could help real estate investors or potential homebuyers identify and target potential neighborhoods in whcih to purchase/invest in property. Key metrics included: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identifying high-growth zip codes</li>
  <li>Comparing commercial vs. residential permit activity>
  <li>Estimating project costs and approval timelines</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>
We completed several steps during our analysis: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data cleansing and preprocessing: Addressing missing values, data spillage, and correcting datatypes.</li>
  <li>Exploratory data analysis: Visualizing permits by class and zipcode, plotting distributions for permit approval time and permit costs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Findings</h2>
<h3>High-growth zip codes:</h3>
  <p>The zip codes in Seattle and their corresponding neighborhoods with the highest number of permits in 2023 were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>98115: Roosevelt, Ravenna, Wedgewood</li>
    <li>98103: Greenlake, Wallingford, Greenwood</li>
    <li>98117: Ballard, Blue Ridge</li>
    <li>98118: Rainier Valley, Seward Park, Rainier Beach</li>
  </ul>
  <p>MAYBE INCLUDE THE VISUAL ON SLIDE 14</p>

<h3>Permit approval times:</h3>
  <p>50% of permits were approved within 50 days, with the approval equaling 79 days</p>
  <p> INSERT VISUAL HERE DISTRIBUTION ON SLIDE 23</p>
  <p>The zip codes with the most expensive estimated project costs were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>98121: Belltown</li>
    <li>98109: Queen Anne</li>
    <li>98108: South Seattle, Beacon Hill</li>
    <li>98101: Downtown Seattle</li>
  </ul>
 

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Project Feasibility: By selecting areas with lower average project costs, developers may be able to execute more financially feasible projects.</li>
  <li>50% of permits approved within 50 days; average construction time = 163 days</li>
  <li>Developers could use this analysis to plan for upcoming projects, both in terms of time required for each key step of the process as well as when they will need construction workers and resources on site and when they could generally expect their project to be complete. This information could be further spliced by a specific permit class, in the event a developer was only interested in timing from 2023 for say “commercial” or “single family/duplex” developments. 
</li>
  <li>Most contractors only handled one project; a few did 3+</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>Insights and Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Homebuyers: focus on low-permit areas for quieter neighborhoods</li>
  <li>Developers: prioritize zip codes with high average project cost and fast approvals</li>
  <li>City planners: use permit density to target infrastructure growth</li>
</ul>
