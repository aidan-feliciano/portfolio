    <h1>Music & Mental Health Analysis</h1>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Can music listening habits predict or influence mental health outcomes? Our study explores how preferences around genre, frequency, and context relate to 
      mental health conditions including anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. We also evaluate whether music can be recommended as a potential support tool for mental well-being.
    </p>

    <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Our data comes from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results">Music & Mental Health Survey</a> dataset on Kaggle. 
      The data was collected via a Google Form, and it includes wide range of attributes: demographic information, music listening patterns, genre preferences, 
      and self-reported mental health scores. Data was collected from 8/27/2022 to 11/9/2022.
    </p>

    <h2>Goal / Key Questions</h2>
    <p>Our analysis was guided by the following research questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do different age groups exhibit distinct listening behaviors?</li>
      <li>Can we predict an individual’s mental health condition (Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, OCD) based on their music habits?</li>
      <li>Does music measurably improve or worsen mental health?</li>
      <li>Can we recommend genres to support mental health improvement?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Insights</h2>

      <h3>Listening Habits by Age Group</h3>
        <p>
          We discovered that musical preferences vary significantly by age. Rock, Pop, and Metal were among the most frequently listened genres across age brackets, 
          while genres like K-pop, Rap, and Lofi skewed heavily toward younger listeners. Classical music, Gospel, and Latin saw higher engagement among older respondents. 
          While usage of platforms like Spotify dominated across all groups, we noticed that older adults reported fewer overall survey responses, which may limit the 
          generalizability of conclusions for that group.

        <h3>Predicting Mental Health Conditions</h3>
        <p>
          We applied linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost to predict self-reported anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD scores. Across the board, models performed
          poorly (R² values < 0.1), suggesting that music habits alone are not strong predictors of mental health scores. Even after introducing engineered features and 
          classification frameworks (Low/Medium/High severity buckets), model accuracy remained around 50–55%. These results highlight that mental health outcomes are likely 
          influenced by external and subjective factors not captured in the dataset. The results of the different models we ran are available in the appendix. 
        </p>
  
      <h3>Does Music Impact Mental Health?</h3>
        <p>
          We shifted our focus to whether individuals felt that music improved, worsened, or had no effect on their mental health. Below is the distribution of Music Effects; we can see that the overwhelming majority
          of survey responses claimed that muisc had a positive effect on mental health.
        </p>
    
        <img src="Music and Mental Health - Mental Health Distributions.png" alt="Distribution of mental health effects">
    
        <p>
          We created a Random Forest Classifier with class balancing with the following details:
          <ul>
            <li> Predictor Variables (X)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Listening behavior</li>
              <li>Musical background</li>
              <li>Music preferences</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Hyperparameters</li>
            <ul>
              <li>n_estimators = 100</li>
              <li>class_weight = "balanced"</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Target Variable (Y)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Music effect on mental health:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Worsens = -1</li>
                <li>No effect = 0</li>
                <li>Improves = 1</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Using this model, we achieved an accuracy of <strong>77.03%</strong> and a weighted F1 score of 0.68, which don't look too bad on paper. However, when we look at the weighted ROC score, 
          we see the big problem; this model barely predicted better than random guessing. 
        </p>
    
        <img src="Music and Mental Health - ROC Curve.png" alt="ROC Curve">
            
        <p>
          When we look at the classification report, we can understand why. 
         </p>
    
        <img src="Music and Mental Health - Classification Report.png" alt="Classification report">
            
        <p>
          The model was able to decently predict that music improved mental health scores because that class dominated the dataset (113 out of 148 test cases were Improves). That’s also the reason 
          for the poor performance of the other classes; they were severely outweighed. However, we did learn some key insights, as when we did some feature importance analysis, we saw that BPM, 
          Hours per day, and video game music frequency were the strongest predictors for mental health in this model. (WILL HAVE TO FIND THE FILE THAT HAS THIS IN COLAB) 
        </p>
        
        
      <h3>Genre Recommendations Using Clustering</h3>
        <p>
          To offer personalized genre recommendations for individuals who reported that music worsened or had no effect on their mental health, we used K-Means algorithm to cluster people into 
          different groups and recommend the top three most-listened-to genres within each group. We also applied PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the nouse in our data. We found that
          five components-Age, Foreign Languagues, While Working, Hours Per Day, and Composer-represent nearly <strong>80%</strong> of the data. Introducing PCA to our analysis increased the 
          Silhouette Score from <strong>0.2</strong> to <strong>0.5</strong>.

        <p>
          We also created a graph to visualize the distribution of individuals. We can see several distinct groups. However, after running a K-Means clustering analysis, 
          we decided to classify them into 39 groups, as this produced the highest silhouette score, indicating the best clustering performance.

    <h2>Limitations & Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      The study faced several limitations: small sample size for older groups, highly subjective self-reporting, and lack of external behavioral indicators. 
      Future work should include broader mental health metrics (e.g. stress levels, sleep quality), and explore synthetic data generation (e.g. SMOTE) to balance class representation.
