# üèóÔ∏è Seattle Building Permits Analysis

This project explored building permit data in the city of Seattle to uncover trends in development activity across neighborhoods, contractors, and project types. We completed two versions of the project ‚Äî one using SQL and one using Python ‚Äî as part of our graduate coursework.

---

## Project Summary

- **Dataset:** Building permit records from [data.seattle.gov](https://data.seattle.gov/)
- **Timeframe:** Permits applied for in **2023**
- **Rows:** 5,596 permits
- **Tools Used:**  
  - SQL (MySQL queries and data cleaning)  
  - Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  

---

## Data Cleaning Challenges

The raw data had formatting issues, including:
- Permit descriptions spilling into other columns
- Missing or blank address and location fields
- Incomplete values for project type descriptors

We wrote SQL scripts to realign columns and fill missing fields based on context (e.g., setting blank city/state fields to `"Seattle, WA"`).

## Key Analyses & Insights

### 1. Permit Density by Zip Code
- Zip codes 98101, 98104, and 98109 had the highest number of commercial permits.
- Several zip codes had under 50 permits, indicating uneven development.

### 2. Housing Trends
- We mapped **Single-Family** vs **Multi-Family** developments.
- Multi-family housing permits clustered in dense areas, signaling urban growth trends.

### 3. Average Project Cost by Zip Code
- We identified the zip codes with the **highest and lowest average costs**, using error bars to show variance.
- This helped highlight cost-efficient areas for developers.

### 4. Permit & Construction Timing
- 50% of permits were approved within **50 days**
- Mean construction time: **163 days**, total project time: **201 days**

### 5. Contractor Activity
- Most contractors only filed 1 permit.
- A handful of companies showed high volume, suggesting strong market presence or specialization.

## Business Use Cases

- ** Homebuyers / Investors:** Identify high-growth areas, predict neighborhood change.
- ** Developers:** Optimize site selection, estimate timelines and cost benchmarks.
- ** Government:** Monitor construction trends, manage public safety in high-density zones.
