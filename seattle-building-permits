# Seattle Building Permits Analysis

---

## Problem

How is construction activity distributed across Seattle?  
We aimed to understand where, what, and how building projects are happening across the city, using permit data to extract trends and draw actionable conclusions for stakeholders such as real estate investors, developers, and city planners.

---

## Data Source

- **Dataset:** [City of Seattle ‚Äì Building Permits (data.seattle.gov)](https://data.seattle.gov/)
- **Filtered:** Permits applied for in **2023**
- **Size:** 5,596 rows √ó 25 columns  
- **Key Fields:** Permit class/type, housing units added/removed, estimated cost, dates, contractor, location (zip code + lat/long)

---

## Goal / Key Metrics

Our goal was to identify key trends in construction activity that could:
- Reveal **high-growth neighborhoods**
- Compare **commercial vs. residential activity**
- Uncover **cost variations** by location
- Analyze **contractor activity**
- Estimate **approval and construction timelines**

---

## Actions

The primary tools we used for the analysis were SQL and Python. Our analysis involved multiple stages:

**1. Data Cleaning**
- Repaired column shifts due to messy text in `Description`
- Reassigned blank `OriginalCity`/`OriginalState` to "Seattle, WA"
- Corrected null or misaligned values for permit metadata

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Grouped permits by zip code and class
- Aggregated permit counts, costs, housing units
- Visualized approval and construction durations

**3. Methods Used**
- SQL queries for aggregation, joins, filtering, date diffs
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for charts and visualizations
- Power BI for supplemental dashboard visualizations

## Results

### üìç Permit Density by Zip Code
- Zip codes **98101**, **98104**, and **98109** had the most commercial permits
- Other zip codes had fewer than 50 permits ‚Äî showing geographic concentration

---

### Housing Development Trends
- Multifamily units clustered in dense, high-growth zip codes
- Single-family housing remained more spread across the city

---

### Project Cost Analysis
- Identified both **high-cost** and **cost-efficient** neighborhoods
- Zip codes with large **cost variance** indicate mixed development types

---

### Timeline Insights
- Median permit approval time: ~50 days
- Mean construction time: 163 days  
- Mean total project time: 201 days

---

## Insights and Next Steps

### Key Insights:
- **Developers** should target high-growth areas like 98101 for commercial projects
- **Homebuyers/investors** can spot rising neighborhoods based on permit activity
- **Contractors** can benchmark approval timelines and project costs
- **Government planners** may use heatmaps and zip-level activity for infrastructure planning

### Challenges:
- Data cleaning was critical due to structural inconsistencies
- Missing location data required careful handling
- Visualizing dense zip code activity made it important to simplify maps

### Next Steps:
- Integrate this data with **property values** or **rental rates**
- Analyze **time series** trends (e.g., seasonality in applications)
- Use **clustering or PCA** for dimensionality reduction across project types
